0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
Background Context
This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part.

Resources
Read or watch:

Sorting algorithm
Big O notation
Sorting algorithms animations
15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes (WARNING: The following video can trigger seizure/epilepsy. It is not required for the project, as it is only a funny visualization of different sorting algorithms)
CS50 Algorithms explanation in detail by David Malan
All about sorting algorithms
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
